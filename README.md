## ‚ú® About the Project  
PathFinderVisualizer is a web-based interactive tool designed to showcase the inner workings of various pathfinding algorithms. Built entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this application lets users create and experiment with custom mazes to see how algorithms navigate obstacles and find optimal paths in real-time.

## üõ† Features  

- **Customizable Grid Environment:**  
  - Draw walls, place start and end nodes, and build your own mazes.  
  - Random maze generation for quick experimentation.  

- **Algorithmic Exploration:**  
  Visualize the following popular pathfinding algorithms:  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  - **Bi-Directional BFS**  
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**  
  - **Greedy Best-First Search**  
  - **A'*' Algorithm**  

- **Dynamic Visualization:**  
  - Observe algorithm behavior step-by-step.  
  - Adjustable speed settings for a personalized learning experience.  

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
  - Lightweight and fast performance with pure JavaScript.
